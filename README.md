# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Getting Started with Create Vite@latest
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# React JS Live Dashboard
It is an End to End Project. Uses [React-ApexCharts.js](https://apexcharts.com/react-chart-demos/) for visualizing data. Data used in this project is dynamic crypto market data. It is being fetched from [coingeko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation).


# Setting up for dashboard
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 21.5.0)
npm (comes with Node.js)
A code editor (e.g., VSCode)


# Install dependencies:

npm install or npm i


# Running the Dashboard

The dashboard will be available at http://localhost:5173/
